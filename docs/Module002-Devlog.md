#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Play E.T. for the atari 2600
- [ ] learn more about game architecture
- [ ] Complete the Case study

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I have both played E.T. for the Atari 2600 and completed the case study for the game
- **Challenges faced**:
  - I didnt have that many issues with the case study since the game is very well documented and available
- **Solutions**:
- N/A

#### Learnings
- I learned alot about what makes an game bad. E.T is one of the most notoriously bad games of all time and now having experienced it myself I can see wy so many people think this way. Level design, mechanics, all of these can hinder the intention of the game if they arent properly developed

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-E.T would probably be a lot better if there was more than a 5 week development time but there also couldve been lots of other changes such as no limit to energy or easier navagational maps or making getting out of pits easier, all of these couldve made the game a lot better in peoples eyes.

#### Next Steps
- My next step is to decide on what type of game I should make for my project.
